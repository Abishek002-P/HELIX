#### **Project Description**

Helix is a Workshop Hub platform

##### **Inspiration**

This pandemic made education a little bit tough for students in the area of understanding and live interaction, so as a team we decided to make our own online educational platform that will be easy to access, free to learn, open to development and innovation. So let us introduce you to "HELIX-XD".

##### **How does the hack solve the Problem given/identified?**

Using the Internet, everything has become easy to access and learn, and with easy teaching from educationalists, understanding is made easier. We are tech-oriented, as of now we are focused on bringing out the best of the latest technology to learn from youtube in a user-friendly and easy-to-access format in our platform. And we also developed our very own live hosting page along with live chat to clear doubts of learners in real-time of live sessions.

##### **How was it built?**

We basically used ReactJS for this project for the User Interfaces (which comprises the front-end of the product) and for the user's authentication we used Firebase, an open-source online DB which is provided by Google. The project is actually a React application and we made it super responsive using Bootstrap version 5.1.3, it is adaptable and responsive for all screen sizes. Moving on to the functionality we built this especially for the students to benefit so we had our perspectives from a student’s point of view and that’s how we built Helix

##### **Challenges faced**

- We faced quite a few challenges which includes the fixes in UI and in responsiveness
- Also, we had a few difficulties in the live streaming and in video players

##### **Accomplishments**

We accomplished almost everything that we wanted to see in our project as a product but still, we are planning to add more features to the project to make it more User interactive and more feasible

##### **Tech stack used**

- We used ReactJS for the frontend
- And Firebase for the authentication and backend
- We used Bootstrap and React Bootstrap as a UI - Framework
- Languages: HTML, javascript,CSS/SCSS
